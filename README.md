This repo contains notebook on EDA and Analytics. 

The following notebook contains code for feature selection filtering methods such as:
1) removing constant features
2) remove quasi-constant features
3) check for duplicated features in the training set
4) find correlated features
5) find important features using univariate roc-auc


The right feature selection can lead a logistic regression algo to surpass the gradient boosting methods.
